# silently environment-dependent. The cases below are weighted toward the FALSE-CLEAN
# direction: a missing report, a headerless report, reports about different corpora,
# and the two verdicts that look like observations but are not (`not-reached`,
# `error`) must all REFUSE, not pass.
#
# Hermetic: fixture reports in a throwaway dir. Never runs `5dive selfcheck`.
