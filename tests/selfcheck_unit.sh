# DIVE-2039 — `5dive selfcheck` runner semantics.
#
# The probes are proven by MUTATION in tests/selfcheck_mutation_e2e.sh (breaking a
# rail for real and requiring red). This harness proves the thing that sits above
# them: that a THIRD VERDICT survives all the way to the exit code.
#
# Weighted toward the FALSE-CLEAN direction, because every way NOT-REACHED can leak
# into "pass" is a way selfcheck goes back to being the instrument it was built to
# replace. A probe that measured nothing must never read as a probe that passed, and
# a probe that measured nothing FOR NO STATED REASON must be a hard failure — the
# reason IS the escape hatch, so an empty one cannot be excusable.
#
# Hermetic: the real probes are never dispatched. `_sc_dispatch` is overridden with a
# fixture table, so this never files a gate, never writes an audit row and never
# shells out.
