# Concatenate src/ into the single-file `5dive` binary the installer fetches.
#
# Why a build step: the installed artifact is a single file (curl install.5dive.com
# | sudo bash drops one binary into /usr/local/bin). The source repo is split for
# readability — see CONTRIBUTING in README.md. CI runs ./build.sh && git diff
# --exit-code 5dive on every push to catch "edited the bundle, forgot to edit
# src/" drift in either direction.
#
# Order matters: header.sh has `set -euo pipefail` + every global / declare -A
# map, so it must come first. main.sh has the EXIT trap and `main "$@"`, so it
# must come last. The middle is grouped by concern (lib/ helpers → cmd_*
# subcommands). state.sh / audit.sh / registry.sh look interleaved because the
# original script's audit block sat between ensure_state and with_registry_lock;
# keeping that order makes the bundle byte-identical with the pre-refactor file.

# Output path is overridable (BUILD_OUT) so tests can build a throwaway binary to a

# DIVE-1261: publish a sha256 of the bundle so the installer can verify the fetched binary before
# swapping it in. Regenerated on every build and committed alongside the bundle; CI's build+diff
# drift check keeps the two in sync.
#
# CNCL-23 regression: generate the sha IMMEDIATELY after writing the bundle, BEFORE any step that
# could abort under `set -e` (the chmod below, the FIVE_VERSION check) — otherwise the bundle and
# its committed sha can DRIFT. A `chmod: Operation not permitted` (building a claude-owned worktree
# as another user) once aborted right before the old sha line, shipping a 0.12.7 bundle carrying
# 0.12.6's sha (PR #95 — CI drift-gate RED, host-roll refused on the mismatch). Order now
# guarantees: whenever $OUT exists on disk post-build, $OUT.sha256 matches it.
