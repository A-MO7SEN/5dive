# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY / GEMINI_API_KEY / OPENROUTER_API_KEY /

# three core providers; DIVE-1205 adds OpenRouter + the Chinese models
# (DeepSeek / GLM-Zhipu[=zai] / Kimi-Moonshot / Qwen). IMPORTANT: these are ALL
# built-in pi providers — pi ships each provider's base_url in its own model
# registry (docs/providers.md "For each provider, pi knows all available
# models"), so 5dive does NOT need a custom base_url; injecting the right
# *_API_KEY var is sufficient and pi resolves the endpoint itself. Qwen has no
# standalone pi provider var, so it routes through OpenRouter. Provider ids
# below match pi's `--provider` / auth.json-key column (docs/providers.md table)
# so a `--model` pin resolves to the correct built-in provider. DIVE-1205.

# BYO provider catalog for hermes/openclaw. The dashboard's new-agent
# wizard collects a canonical id (lowercase, vendor-style) from the user;
# this table maps it to the provider id each agent CLI's native registry
# recognizes plus a sensible default model so the agent's first launch
# doesn't sit at a "model not configured" prompt. Empty string in the
# native column means the type's registry doesn't have that vendor — the
# wizard hides that tile for that agent type.
#
# Native ids were verified empirically:
#   - hermes auth add <p> --type api-key --api-key <k>   (writes ~/.hermes/auth.json,
#       auto-resolves base_url from the in-tree provider catalog).
#   - openclaw writes auth-profiles.json with type:"api_key" entries; provider
#       ids must match openclaw's built-in provider registry (anthropic, openai,
#       google, deepseek, moonshot, openrouter all present).
#
# hermes-moonshot is a special case: its registry has a Kimi provider but no
# `hermes auth add moonshot` subcommand — the key is read from KIMI_API_KEY in
# ~/.hermes/.env at gateway startup (see .env.example upstream). _apply_byo_hermes
# branches on canonical=="moonshot" to take the env-var path instead of `auth add`,
# and cmd_create copies the value into agent-<name>'s own .env before the gateway

# Explicit BYO provider base_url override for openclaw, keyed by canonical id.
# openclaw's own provider catalog resolves each provider's endpoint, and for most
# providers that's correct so no entry is listed here. z.ai is the exception
# (DIVE-1826, the openclaw sibling of the DIVE-1819 hermes fix):
#
#   1. openclaw's zai provider speaks z.ai's OpenAI-compatible REST surface
#      (`/paas/v4`), NOT the anthropic-wire endpoint. So — unlike hermes and pi,
#      which pin `api.z.ai/api/anthropic` (HERMES_PROVIDER_URL / CLAUDE_PROVIDER_
#      BASEURL) — openclaw must be pointed at the openai-compat *coding* URL
#      `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4`. Pinning the anthropic URL here would
#      break openclaw (wrong wire format). The two override tables are deliberately
#      NOT shared for this reason.
#   2. z.ai exposes four endpoint families (zai-global / zai-cn / zai-coding-global
#      / zai-coding-cn). openclaw's `zai-api-key` auto-detect probes the GENERAL
#      endpoints (zai-global, zai-cn) BEFORE the Coding Plan ones, and our create
#      path writes a bare `{provider:zai}` auth profile that never runs that probe
#      — so a GLM Coding-Plan key (which authorizes the *coding* surface) lands on
#      the general endpoint and 401s "authentication failed" (what lodar hit).
#      Pinning models.providers.zai.baseUrl to the coding-global URL selects the
#      right surface deterministically. Coding-Plan CN users override per agent
#      (`5dive agent <name> tui`) — we default to the global coding endpoint.

# --- Claude (Claude Code) harness BYO custom-provider catalog -----------------
# The claude harness can be pointed at any third-party provider that ships an
# Anthropic Messages-API-compatible endpoint by overriding ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL +
# ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN and the per-tier model ids (the modern Claude Code knobs
# ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU}_MODEL — so whichever tier the agent
# selects, and the background haiku tasks, map to a model the provider actually
# serves instead of 404-ing on "claude-…"). Only providers with a documented
# anthropic-compat endpoint are listed; the rest of BYO_PROVIDER_LABEL is
# intentionally absent here (no compat path → would break the harness). Model
# ids drift upstream — operators can override per agent via the model picker, or
# we bump these. Values verified against vendor Claude-Code docs 2026-06-03.
# OpenRouter (DIVE-1100): OpenRouter ships a NATIVE Anthropic-skin endpoint at
# https://openrouter.ai/api (Claude Code appends /v1/messages), so the harness
# talks to it directly — no translation proxy. The OpenRouter key rides
# ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (sk-or-…) and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY must be empty; both are
# already handled by _apply_byo_claude. NOTE: OpenRouter's Anthropic endpoint
# TRANSLATES — it accepts any OpenRouter model slug (openai/*, google/*, z-ai/*,
# deepseek/*, meta-llama/*) in Anthropic wire format and converts it, verified
# 2026-07-10 including a real headless Claude Code turn on z-ai/glm-4.6. The
# "openrouter/auto" alias does NOT resolve here (it's an OpenAI-format router
# convenience, not a real model), so we pin concrete per-tier defaults to
# anthropic/* as a SAFE DEFAULT — operators override any tier via
# `agent create --model=<slug>` or `agent config set model=<slug>` (DIVE-1103).
# Slugs verified against the LIVE openrouter.ai /api/v1/models list 2026-07-25
# (DIVE-1897). Verified present: anthropic/claude-opus-5, anthropic/claude-sonnet-5,
# anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5, openrouter/auto. NOTE haiku is deliberately NOT bumped:
# there is no claude-haiku-5 on OpenRouter, 4.5 is the current haiku. NOTE the opus
# slot was the only stale entry — its sibling sonnet was already at 5, so one tier had
# been bumped and the other had not.
