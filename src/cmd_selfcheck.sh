# --- selfcheck: prove the rails ACTED (DIVE-2039, v0.16 "Fails loud") ---------
#
# The v0.16 headline capability. Every other check we own grades a rail on what it
# REPORTED. This one grades it on what it CHANGED.
#
# 24h of defects (0.15.8 -> 0.15.30) had one shape: a rail that reported success and
# changed nothing. A harness exiting 0 with a stranded verdict (DIVE-2003). Nine audit
# sub-events gated on $EUID so an agent's own actions left no row (DIVE-1989). Gates
# filed, reported pinged, recording nothing — 194 undelivered rows AFTER the first fix
# (DIVE-1968/1927). crontab-snapshot exiting 0 having saved nothing (DIVE-1991/1994).
# install/self-update serving a bundle and its checksum from different cache
# generations (DIVE-1977). A scorecard rendering a partial read as a number
# (DIVE-1929/1937). None of these was caught by running the rail and reading its output,
# because running the rail and reading its output is exactly what they all survive.
#
# THREE VERDICTS, NOT TWO. Every probe reports pass | fail | NOT-REACHED, and
# NOT-REACHED is a first-class third state that is NEVER folded into pass. That is the
# DIVE-2018 gap stated as a design rule: a probe whose precondition is absent has not
# been shown to work, and a check that cannot say so reports "fine" for a rail nobody
# measured. A NOT-REACHED with no reason is not excusable and exits non-zero — the
# escape hatch is the precondition, never the silence.
#
# NOT-REACHED IS NOT FREE. It is excusable in ONE run and never in ALL of them:
# `--report=<file>` emits a machine-readable verdict per probe, and
# tests/meta/selfcheck-union.sh asserts the corpus is REACHED in the union of the
# pristine and installed-host jobs. A probe not-reached everywhere is permanently
# unmeasured and permanently green — the same defect one level up in the instrument.
#
# ISOLATED, ALWAYS. Every probe that writes runs against its own STATE_DIR / TASKS_DB /
# AUDIT_LOG / notify log under a throwaway dir, never the live store. This is not
# politeness: the DIVE-1968 diagnosis was mis-read for a day because fixture rows and
# real rows shared one file (DIVE-2010), so a prover that contaminated the evidence
# base would be building the next mis-diagnosis. Human sends are fenced twice over —
# FIVEDIVE_NO_HUMAN_SEND plus a non-prod TASKS_DB (the DIVE-1506 positive allowlist).
#
# PROVEN BY MUTATION, NOT BY A GREEN RUN. A green run cannot tell a working probe from
# a probe that asserts nothing. tests/selfcheck_mutation_e2e.sh breaks each of the
# first three rails for real and requires selfcheck to go red, then restores and
# requires green. "It passed" is not evidence here; "it failed when I broke it" is.

# The corpus, in order. Declared in ONE place: the report header, the --list output and
# the union script's contract all read this, so they cannot drift into three lists.

# written intending to record something, and the hole appeared anyway).

# one: a silent delivery must synthesise an `error` row and downgrade rc 0 -> 3, while
# a CONFIRMED-but-unrecorded send must backfill an `ok` row carrying the chat it
# reached. Labelling the second a failure would manufacture error rows for gates that

5dive selfcheck [--json] [--only=<probe,...>] [--full] [--strict]
                [--report=<file>] [--label=<env>] [--list]

Runs each critical rail FOR REAL in an isolated state dir and asserts the EFFECT it
is supposed to have, not the string it printed.

Every probe reports pass | fail | NOT-REACHED. NOT-REACHED is a first-class third
state and is NEVER folded into pass — a probe whose precondition is absent has not
been shown to work. A NOT-REACHED with no reason exits non-zero.

  --full      run the harness mutation sweep over the whole corpus (slow; CI)
  --strict    treat any NOT-REACHED as a failure (for a single known-complete env)
  --allow=    probes this DEPLOYMENT structurally cannot reach, excused in the
              union (recorded in the report, never restated by the union)
  --report=   write a machine-readable verdict per probe, for the union check
  --label=    name this environment in the report (default: host:uid)
  --list      print the probe corpus, one per line

exit 0  every probe passed, or was NOT-REACHED with a declared reason
exit 1  any fail, any probe error, or any NOT-REACHED with no reason given

NOT-REACHED is excusable in ONE environment, never in all of them. Run selfcheck in
both the pristine and installed-host jobs with --report=, then:

  tests/meta/selfcheck-union.sh pristine.txt installed.txt

which fails if any probe reached a verdict NOWHERE.
